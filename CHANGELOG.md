# Changelog

All notable changes to ModularCA are recorded here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the project aims to follow
semantic versioning: a new capability is a minor release, a fix is a patch.

## [Unreleased]

### Enrollment protocols

- **Windows autoenrollment, first step.** A Certificate Enrollment Web Service endpoint
  (MS-WSTEP over HTTPS) at `/api/v1/msae/{caLabel}/ces` answers a `RequestSecurityToken` with
  the issued certificate and chain. Callers authenticate with a WS-Security UsernameToken or HTTP
  Basic through the same credential service as EST, and must hold the enrollment capability on
  the CA. The template a client names in its CSR selects a ModularCA certificate template; a
  request naming none uses the CA's MSAE protocol configuration, which is enabled per CA on the
  protocol configuration page. The policy service (MS-XCEP), Kerberos authentication, renewal
  and pending requests are still to come.
- MSAE is wired through the same surfaces as the other enrollment protocols: an `MSAE.Enabled`
  feature flag (setup wizard and `bootstrap.yaml`, off by default) gating the paths, per-CA
  protocol rows seeded at CA creation, its own audit table and tab (`AuditMsae`, with the
  template the client named), IP whitelisting, rate limiting and the login-attempt budget for
  HTTP Basic, the public portal's endpoint listing, and the API documentation.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-09-14

First public release. ModularCA is a modular private certificate authority: a .NET 10 backend
with ACME, EST, CMP, SCEP, OCSP and TSA, and browser front ends for administration,
self-service, public enrollment, setup and documentation.

### Enrollment protocols

- **EST (RFC 7030)** works end to end: anonymous `/cacerts` at both the direct and the
  `.well-known/est/` path, HTTP Basic authentication through a named scheme that shares the
  interactive login's lockout and audit, and mutual-TLS enrollment on a dedicated SNI subdomain
  that requests a client certificate without requiring one so the bootstrap step still answers.
  A presented certificate is chain-validated against the CA it enrolls against, its issuer checked
  as the direct issuer with a client-authentication EKU, and the anchor set is refreshed at
  runtime.
- **CMP (RFC 4210)** works for PBMAC shared-secret enrollment and signature-protected requests.
  Each CA can hold a dedicated CMP message-signing certificate — issued beside its OCSP responder
  and TSA signer — so signature-protected responses verify in standards-based clients; a request
  is bound to the names its signer already holds.
- The admin enrollment page is a single form: choose a protocol (QR page, EST, SCEP, or a CMP
  shared-secret credential) and the fields and result follow the choice.

### Security

- Remediation of a whole-codebase security review: all High findings and the great majority of
  Medium findings across authentication, TLS trust boundaries, the enrollment protocols,
  configuration defaults, input handling and the front ends. Notable fixes include the IP
  whitelist failing closed on a cold snapshot, the setup wizard requiring a token on a
  configured-but-empty instance, SSH `force-command` argument handling, credential changes ending
  sessions, per-tenant scoping of user listings, and enforcement of per-CA ACME and CMP policy
  settings that were previously stored but never read.
- Certificate content for Windows endpoints — client-authentication, smartcard-logon and KDC
  extended key usages, and UPN `otherName` SANs — is issued and displayed correctly.

### Known limitations

- Active Directory Group Policy autoenrollment is not yet supported; it is the next line of work.
- Enrollment tokens and CMP shared secrets are stored in a recoverable form, and the SPA holds
  its session tokens in browser storage. Both are tracked for a later release.
